# Project: Nursing Home Possessions Management System

## Description
This project is designed to enhance the management and tracking of possessions belonging to residents in a nursing home. It introduces new features aimed at improving security, accountability, and ease of use for both staff and residents.

## Features
### Better Comment System
Improve the comment system to allow for clearer, more detailed entries regarding each resident's possessions and any actions taken.

### Request Locked Drawer
Implement a system for staff to securely request access to locked drawers where resident possessions are stored. This system logs requests and grants access based on staff authorization levels.

### Signature with Staff and Resident for Individual Export
Enhance security and accountability by requiring digital signatures from both staff and residents whenever possessions are exported or moved out of storage. This feature helps confirm both identity and approval of the involved parties.

### Username Display
Ensure that every interaction with the system records and displays the username of the staff member, adding a layer of traceability and responsibility to actions within the system.

### Enhanced Table Formatting
Refine the visual presentation of tables that list residents and their possessions, improving readability and making the interface more user-friendly.

### Scroll Wheel Implementation
Optimize the display of large lists by implementing a scroll wheel functionality, limiting the number of visible entries to 10-15 at a time. This helps manage screen real estate and improves navigation.
