# Project: Enhanced Healthcare Management System

## Description
This project aims to enhance the healthcare management system by introducing several new features to improve interaction and security for both staff and residents. Key features include:
- A better comment system for more effective communication.
- A request locked drawer system for secure storage of sensitive items.
- Signature verification for exports involving both staff and residents to ensure accountability.
- Displaying the username of the staff member involved in each operation for better traceability.
- Improved data table formats and user interface elements for easier navigation and reading.

## Features
### Better Comment System
Enhance the existing comment system to facilitate clearer and more structured communications between staff members.

### Request Locked Drawer
Implement a secure system where staff can request access to a locked drawer, ensuring that sensitive items are stored securely and access is logged and monitored.

### Signature with Staff and Resident for Individual Export
Introduce a digital signature system that requires confirmation from both the involved staff member and the resident for any data export, ensuring both consent and validity of the information.

### Username Display
Modify the system to display the username of the staff member who performs any action within the system, for better accountability and tracking.

### Enhanced Table Formatting
Improve the format of the tables used to display data within the system. Ensure that tables are easy to read and navigate.

### Scroll Wheel Implementation
Implement a scroll wheel functionality for tables displaying names, limiting the default view to 10-15 entries to prevent overwhelming users and to facilitate easier navigation.
